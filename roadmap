App-Subcommander tests:

Now:

  - show help (no command, bad command, help command w/o args)
  - help with a command (cmd help $cmd)
  - app options (--config preceding subcommand)
  - type map stuff (Effort $e)
  - coercion (when someone does Str $s as Int)
  - Return value for run?
  - short options (-s)
      - argument bundling
  - list parameters (Str @foo)
  - negated boolean flags (no, no-, make sure this wouldn't clash with --node)
  - option terminator (--)

Later:

  - Document how slurpies all share the same type
  - Should we worry if a non-Str is passed to run?
  - What if command and app options clash?
  - What if a subcommand nextsame's its parent?  pos/named args?
  - how will --config work (if I have something like --interactive?)
  - what if the value for an option is optional? (ex. --password)
  - multis

Extensions:

  - Shortened subcommand names
  - Interactive input of missing options
  - bash/zsh completion generation?
  - non-strict mode wrt. extra options
  - What if I want a default subcommand?
